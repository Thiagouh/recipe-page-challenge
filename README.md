## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I finally understand how to use @font-face (I believe)! This challenge made me better analyze the use of semantic structure and tags related to it.

### Continued development

I intend to delve deeper into the necessary means and understand them well to solve the proposed challenges. I also intend to use libraries for future challenges.
